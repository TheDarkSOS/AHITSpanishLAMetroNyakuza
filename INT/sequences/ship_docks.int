fishdude2 = Oh, hey dudette. I was just chilling, you know, and I noticed all this broken glass around. Weird, right?
fishdude3 = ... It belongs to you? Ah, cool, cool. Broken glass would like, totally violate code 1.3a of the maritime safety order, but if it's yours that's like, no big deal.
fishdude4 = Now this corridor on the other hand, woah. Really sinking my calm vibe, you know?

captain1 = I said I'm busy, pup.
captain2 = Don't you have anything better to do?

mafiaboss0 = [scream]Agh![/scream] These annoying little seals are driving me mad.  
mafiaboss1 = At least you, rude child, have the good grace to keep quiet.

conductor3 = Yer a capable one, sure, but what I'm having isnae for young lasses.

octopus0 = Watch your step there, spark! It'd be real [shake2]shocking[/shake2] if you slipped.
octopus1 = I'm [shake2]positive[/shake2] they could make it a little safer down there, but I guess that'd really [shake2]amp[/shake2] up the costs.

captainAttention0 = Attention... this is your Captain speaking.
captain0 = What's that, pup? [br]You want to help out?
captain1 = Hmph. Sure. Maybe something will get done around this mess of a boat for once. It'd be a first.
captain2 = Alright. You'll need to deliver drinks, some food, and a few other things. And do it quickly, pup.
captain3 = Oh, and there are some other jobs that'll need doing. So pay attention. Are you ready to start?
captain4 = Well, come back when you are. This ship isn't going to clean itself up.
captain5 = Good. You can start by getting rid of some of these boxes for me. It's starting to get messy in here...
captainFail0 = Just like the seals... that's no good. You just made more of a mess, pup. Try again. Or don't, whatever.
captainDone0 = You can stop now, pup. Come back to Control, I guess.
captainDone1 = Well... looks like you actually cleaned up more mess than you made, pup. That's more than most of the crew can manage.

binocs0 = Wow! The ship looks incredible! And safe! Incredibly safe, you might say.

crates0 = The label on this crate reads 'PBR'. Whoever they are, they're good at making shiny things.

captain0 = Uh... you look a little young to be sailing alone, pup.
captain1 = Whatever. Just don't get in anyone's way. The 'crew' do enough of that already.
captain2 = See the walkway, pup? What a mess...
captain3 = How is anyone supposed to get up that thing? 
captain4 = They can't even make a straight walkway. Surprised the whole thing doesn't fall apart.

conductor0 = Well, if it isn't the little lass. How's stardom treating you?
conductor1a = Tell you the truth, I'm taking some time off after that [br]peck-neck [icon:djgrooves] DJ tried tae to, y'know, kill you.
conductor1b = Oh, and sorry about the whole... knife incident. [br]What's a wee argument between colleagues though, lassy?
conductor1c = I'm taking some time off tae relax. Getting away from that noisy [br][icon:djgrooves][name]DJ Grooves[/name] fer a while.

mafiaboss0 = Ah! First you kill me, then you torment me by booking passage on [br]the only cruise liner here with facilities for people in jars!
mafiaboss1 = Such a rude little child. Were I not in a pleasant holiday mood [br][small]and still without a body[/small] I would take my revenge right here and now!

seals0 = They look like they're having an nice time! [br]Though they probably shouldn't be left unattended.

snatcher3 = [shake2]You really are just the worst, kiddo.[/shake2]
snatcher4 = [shake2]...Yes, I'm hiding in a crate. Tickets are expensive.[/shake2]

penguins0 = The tickets for this thing are pricey, but we helped ourselves to the old 1-flipper discount, if you know what I mean.
penguins1 = The boss wanted to be here, but when he heard the [icon:conductor][name]Conductor[/name] is here he decided to focus on his next movie instead.
penguins2 = I hope there's something other to do than take a dip. Keep it to yourself kid, but we ain't the swimmin' type, capisce?

start0 = It's all going down, pup. I never thought I'd see the day.

captain1 = I'm not sure which of these little mischief-makers thought they could take a turn steering, but you got everyone to safety.
captain2 = Hopefully our insurance covers this...
captain3 = Anyway, I can't give out refunds, but I found this is some of the broken ice.

tourist0 = Kinda hoping we pass close by an island or something soon. I need something to take pictures of!

deskseals1 = But that's mean! Wefunds for evewyone, hooway!

restowl0 = I hope they don't burn the food. I'm not a chef, but I'm pretty sure that's not a normal amount of fire.
restpenguin0 = The service here is terible, kid. I'd pick somewhere else to eat if I were you.

tlpenguin0 = This is the only bathroom on this thing! There has to be another way in! I'm gettin' desperate over here, kid.

owls0 = I'm thinking of quitting the movie business. The [name]Conductor's[/name] movies are always just action - where's the drama? Where's the artistry?
owls1 = Maybe I could work in video games instead...
owls2 = I followed some nice new people on Chirper today! I'm sure I won't regret it.
owls3 = I thought the pool would be heated seeing as it's so cold out, but... it isn't!
owls4 = I almost froze my feathers off trying to take a dip earlier.
owls5 = The [name]Conductor's[/name] grandkids are a... bit of a handful, huh? I'm glad it isn't my job to keep an eye on them.

penguins0 = I tried to get the boss to tell us about his next movie before we left, but he's tight-lipped about it.
penguins1 = I forgot to download anything to listen to before I left, and there's no wi-fi signal out here! This holiday is the worst.

penguins3 = You feelin' lucky, kid?

alpinewanderer0 = It's good to be travelling again! Though the view here is not quite as nice as the one in the Alps.
alpinewanderer1 = Take a look at that ocean! Isn't it beautiful?
alpinewanderer2 = This way to the- ah, I mean, hello! That's a tough habit to shake.
alpinewanderer3 = It's pretty cold back home, but I've never seen ice as big as that!

cookingcat0 = Well hi there! How's it going?

ticketcrow1 = We crows all won our tickets in a sweepstakes. All of us. It was incredibly lucky.
ticketcrow2 = You must have bought yours legitimately. For purely casual reasons, how many [icon:pon] did you pay?
ticketcrow3 = Interesting. [TicketPrice] [icon:pon] seems like a normal price for cruise tickets.
ticketcrow4 = Normal, and not incongurent with your bank statement at all.

destinationcrow0 = Good evening, fellow passenger. I hope you are enjoying your journey.
destinationcrow1 = Do you know where this cruise is going? It was written on all of our tickets, but the writing was smudged.
destinationcrow2 = On all of them. It was a very unlikely accident. Can you remind us where we are headed?
destinationcrow3 = Oh, of course, [Destination]. I remember now, having seen it written down earlier. On my ticket.

familycrow0 = I have family in [Destination]. I am very glad that is where we are going. 
familycrow1 = It is why I got on this cruise, of course.

reviewcrow0 = What do you mean we aren't on the list for dinner?
reviewcrow1 = We paid exactly [TicketPrice] [icon:pon] for tickets, just like every other real passenger.
reviewcrow2 = There will be a bad review left on this cruise trip. 

leaflets0 = It's a bunch of leaflets for ritzy spa treatments! They're not covered in your ticket price, though.

clipboard0 = You haven't the faintest clue what any of this means, but the handwriting's surprisingly good for a seal.
